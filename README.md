This product allows the user to create a list of profiles stored in the format of a linked list using pointers in C++. 
The user can then create a new profile if they say no to initial prompting to create a file.
This new file is matched with all the previous made profiles and then the user is provided with the idex id of the first player that they are related to
It runs on Windows through the users console.
